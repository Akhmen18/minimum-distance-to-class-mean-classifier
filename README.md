# Minimum-Distance-to-Class-Mean-Classifier

Pattern Recognition

## Goal

Follow the instructions will get you familiar with how to do minimum distance to class mean (MDTCM) classifiers in **Python**. The goal is to train a classifier, using Euclidean distance (L2 norm), and find the minimum error rate. 

The dataset can be reached in the [UCI Wine Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). In this example, use MDTCM classifier to classify 3 different wine cultivars from the same region in Italy with minimum error rate. Error rate is defined as the number of misclassified data points divided by the total number of data points classified, in percentage.

Strech: Find 2 out of 13 features that contribute to the classifier most without using any library. (Computation time not required)
