# Minimum-Distance-to-Class-Mean-Classifier

Pattern Recognition

## Goal

Follow the instructions will get you familiar with how to do minimum distance to class mean (MDTCM) classifiers in **Python**. The goal is to train a classifier to find features that have the minimum error rate. The dataset can be reached in the [UCI Wine Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). In this repository, I try MDTCM to find 2 features (attributes) out of 13 that can better classify the 3 different wine cultivars from the same region in Italy.
